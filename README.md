# TransitionalMCMC.jl


Our tmcmc tests in julia

To do:

* Fix vector bugs
* Make N-D
* Fix MHsample, or import from another repo


I believe that the code should eventually be included in the repo that Jasper and I are working on: [UncertaintyQuantification.jl](https://github.com/FriesischScott/UncertaintyQuantification.jl)

Maybe keeping it separate and importing this code otherwise.

If you're interested in contributing there also. Hopefully one day it'll have some nice calabilities.
